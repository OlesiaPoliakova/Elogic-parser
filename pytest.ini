1. Virtual Environment Not Activated in Terminal
Problem: PyCharm automatically activates the virtual environment when running tests, but in the terminal, you need to manually activate it.
Solution: In the terminal, make sure you are activating the virtual environment before running pytest. Run the following commands:
bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
After activating the virtual environment, run:
bash
Copy code
pytest
If you don't activate the virtual environment, the terminal may not find the required dependencies, such as pytest or requests-mock.
